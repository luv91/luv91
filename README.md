## ðŸš€ Tableau Netflix Visualization Project

### ðŸ“Š Netflix Movies and TV Shows Dashboard

I built a **Tableau Dashboard** to analyze Netflix movies and TV shows, focusing on key metrics like production year, content distribution, and top categories across different countries.

## ðŸŽ¥ Novel NeRF Reconstruction Methods Comparison

This research demonstrates improved NeRF reconstruction quality using True-Log color space compared to traditional sRGB approach. The comparisons below showcase the visual differences between current literature methods and our proposed approach.

Our approach leverages the logarithmic RGB data captured in the True-Log space to enhance the performance of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). True-Log encodings improve depth reconstruction and rendering quality by aligning with the physical behavior of light reflection and enabling better scene representations.

### ðŸ“„ Summary from Research
- **True-Log Improves NeRF Performance**: Models trained on True-Log achieve superior results in Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) across 360-degree and LLFF scenes.
- **Enhanced Depth Reconstruction**: True-Log representations significantly enhance depth maps and preserve details in both shadows and highlights.
- **Alignment with Physical Laws**: By decoupling illumination and reflectance, the logarithmic transformation enables NeRFs to better understand scene structure and lighting conditions.

### ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž In our ArXiv research article (from the Computer Vision section) on ablation analysis of Vector Quantized Generative Adversarial Networks (VQGANs) for image-to-image synthesis, we delved into understanding the discrete latent space, specifically studying the effects of varying its size on image reconstruction.
#### The figure below is shown as an example and it visually compares original images with their corresponding reconstructions under different configurations: one without positional encoding and the other introducing 2D positional encodings. Please go through the article to delve deeper

### ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž In another ArXiv article (from the Computation and Language section) on optimizing transformer-based machine translation models for single GPU training, we conducted an extensive hyperparameter ablation study. 
#### Table 1 (shown below) from the paper provides a detailed analysis of the impact of various hyperparameters on model performance and the associated parameter count for each configuration over 100 epochs. Please go through the article to delve deeper.
